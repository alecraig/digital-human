<introduction>HERE BEGINNETH A TREATISE HOW THE HIGH FATHER OF HEAVEN SENDETH 
DEATH TO SUMMON EVERY CREATURE TO COME AND GIVE ACCOUNT OF THEIR 
LIVES IN THIS WORLD AND IS IN MANNER OF A MORAL PLAY.</introduction>



<speech><line><speaker char="Messenger">Messenger</speaker> I pray you all give your audience,</line>
<line>And hear this matter with reverence,</line>
<line>By figure a moral play--</line>
<line>The Summoning of Everyman called it is,</line>
<line>That of our lives and ending shows</line>
<line>How transitory we be all day.</line>
<line>This matter is wondrous precious,</line>
<line>But the intent of it is more gracious,</line>
<line>And sweet to bear away.</line>
<line>The story saith,--Man, in the beginning,</line>
<line>Look well, and take good heed to the ending,</line>
<line>Be you never so gay!</line>
<line>Ye think sin in the beginning full sweet,</line>
<line>Which in the end causeth thy soul to weep,</line>
<line>When the body lieth in clay.</line>
<line>Here shall you see how <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> and <referent char="Jollity">Jollity</referent>,</line>
<line>Both <referent char="Strength">Strength</referent>, <referent char="Pleasure">Pleasure</referent>, and <referent char="Beauty">Beauty</referent>,</line>
<line>Will fade from thee as flower in May.</line>
<line>For ye shall hear, how our heaven king</line>
<line>Calleth <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> to a general reckoning:</line>
<line>Give audience, and hear what he doth say.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="God">God</speaker> I perceive here in my majesty,</line>
<line>How that all creatures be to me unkind,</line>
<line>Living without dread in worldly prosperity:</line>
<line>Of ghostly sight the people be so blind,</line>
<line>Drowned in sin, they know me not for their God;</line>
<line>In worldly riches is all their mind,</line>
<line>They fear not my rightwiseness, the sharp rod;</line>
<line>My law that I shewed, when I for them died,</line>
<line>They forget clean, and shedding of my blood red;</line>
<line>I hanged between two, it cannot be denied;</line>
<line>To get them life I suffered to be dead;</line>
<line>I healed their feet, with thorns hurt was my head:</line>
<line>I could do no more than I did truly,</line>
<line>And now I see the people do clean forsake me.</line>
<line>They use the seven deadly sins damnable;</line>
<line>As pride, covetise, wrath, and lechery,</line>
<line>Now in the world be made commendable;</line>
<line>And thus they leave of angels the heavenly company;</line>
<line>Everyman liveth so after his own pleasure,</line>
<line>And yet of their life they be nothing sure:</line>
<line>I see the more that I them forbear</line>
<line>The worse they be from year to year;</line>
<line>All that liveth appaireth<note n="7"/> fast,</line>
<line>Therefore I will in all the haste</line>
<line>Have a reckoning of Everyman's person</line>
<line>For and I leave the people thus alone</line>
<line>In their life and wicked tempests,</line>
<line>Verily they will become much worse than beasts;</line>
<line>For now one would by envy another up eat;</line>
<line>Charity they all do clean forget.</line>
<line>I hoped well that Everyman</line>
<line>In my glory should make his mansion,</line>
<line>And thereto I had them all elect;</line>
<line>But now I see, like traitors deject,</line>
<line>They thank me not for the pleasure that I to them meant,</line>
<line>Nor yet for their being that I them have lent;</line>
<line>I proffered the people great multitude of mercy,</line>
<line>And few there be that asketh it heartily;</line>
<line>They be so cumbered with worldly riches,</line>
<line>That needs on them I must do justice,</line>
<line>On Everyman living without fear.</line>
<line>Where art thou, <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, thou mighty messenger?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Almighty God, I am here at your will,</line>
<line>Your commandment to fulfil.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="God">God</speaker> Go thou to <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>,</line>
<line>And show him in my name</line>
<line>A pilgrimage he must on him take,</line>
<line>Which he in no wise may escape;</line>
<line>And that he bring with him a sure reckoning</line>
<line>Without delay or any tarrying.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Lord, I will in the world go run over all,</line>
<line>And cruelly outsearch both great and small;</line>
<line>Every man will I beset that liveth beastly</line>
<line>Out of God's laws, and dreadeth not folly:</line>
<line>He that loveth riches I will strike with my dart,</line>
<line>His sight to blind, and from heaven to depart,</line>
<line>Except that alms be his good friend,</line>
<line>In hell for to dwell, world without end.</line>
<line>Lo, yonder I see <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> walking;</line>
<line>Full little he thinketh on my coming;</line>
<line>His mind is on fleshly lusts and his treasure,</line>
<line>And great pain it shall cause him to endure</line>
<line>Before the Lord Heaven King.</line>
<line><referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, stand still; whither art thou going</line>
<line>Thus gaily? Hast thou thy Maker forget?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Why askst thou?</line>
<line>Wouldest thou wete?<note n="8"/></line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Yea, sir, I will show you;</line>
<line>In great haste I am sent to thee</line>
<line>From God out of his majesty.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> What, sent to me?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Yea, certainly.</line>
<line>Though thou have forget him here,</line>
<line>He thinketh on thee in the heavenly sphere,</line>
<line>As, or we depart, thou shalt know.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> What desireth God of me?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> That shall I show thee;</line>
<line>A reckoning he will needs have</line>
<line>Without any longer respite.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> To give a reckoning longer leisure I crave;</line>
<line>This blind matter troubleth my wit.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> On thee thou must take a long journey:</line>
<line>Therefore thy book of count with thee thou bring;</line>
<line>For turn again thou can not by no way,</line>
<line>And look thou be sure of thy reckoning:</line>
<line>For before God thou shalt answer, and show</line>
<line>Thy many bad deeds and good but a few;</line>
<line>How thou hast spent thy life, and in what wise,</line>
<line>Before the chief lord of paradise.</line>
<line>Have ado that we were in that way,</line>
<line>For, wete thou well, thou shalt make none attournay.<note n="9"/></line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Full unready I am such reckoning to give.</line>
<line>I know thee not: what messenger art thou?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> I am <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, that no man dreadeth.</line>
<line>For every man I rest and no man spareth;</line>
<line>For it is God's commandment</line>
<line>That all to me should be obedient.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, thou comest when I had thee least in mind;</line>
<line>In thy power it lieth me to save,</line>
<line>Yet of my good will I give thee, if ye will be kind,</line>
<line>Yea, a thousand pound shalt thou have,</line>
<line>And defer this matter till another day.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, it may not be by no way;</line>
<line>I set not by gold, silver, nor riches,</line>
<line>Ne by pope, emperor, king, duke, ne princes.</line>
<line>For and I would receive gifts great,</line>
<line>All the world I might get;</line>
<line>But my custom is clean contrary.</line>
<line>I give thee no respite: come hence, and not tarry.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Alas, shall I have no longer respite?</line>
<line>I may say <referent char="Death">Death</referent> giveth no warning:</line>
<line>To think on thee, it maketh my heart sick,</line>
<line>For all unready is my book of reckoning.</line>
<line>But twelve year and I might have abiding,</line>
<line>My counting book I would make so clear,</line>
<line>That my reckoning I should not need to fear.</line>
<line>Wherefore, <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, I pray thee, for God's mercy,</line>
<line>Spare me till I be provided of remedy.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Thee availeth not to cry, weep, and pray:</line>
<line>But haste thee lightly that you were gone the journey,</line>
<line>And prove thy friends if thou can.</line>
<line>For, wete thou well, the tide abideth no man,</line>
<line>And in the world each living creature</line>
<line>For <referent char="Adam's">Adam's</referent> sin must die of nature.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, if I should this pilgrimage take,</line>
<line>And my reckoning surely make,</line>
<line>Show me, for saint <referent char="charity">charity</referent>,</line>
<line>Should I not come again shortly?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> No, <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>; and thou be once there,</line>
<line>Thou mayst never more come here,</line>
<line>Trust me verily.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O gracious God, in the high seat celestial,</line>
<line>Have mercy on me in this most need;</line>
<line>Shall I have no company from this vale terrestrial</line>
<line>Of mine acquaintance that way me to lead?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Yea, if any be so hardy,</line>
<line>That would go with thee and bear thee company.</line>
<line>Hie thee that you were gone to God's magnificence,</line>
<line>Thy reckoning to give before his presence.</line>
<line>What, weenest thou thy life is given thee,</line>
<line>And thy worldly goods also?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> I had wend so, verily.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Nay, nay; it was but lent thee;</line>
<line>For as soon as thou art go,</line>
<line>Another awhile shall have it, and then go therefro</line>
<line>Even as thou hast done.</line>
<line><referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, thou art mad; thou hast thy wits five,</line>
<line>And here on earth will not amend thy life,</line>
<line>For suddenly I do come.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O wretched caitiff, whither shall I flee,</line>
<line>That I might scape this endless sorrow!</line>
<line>Now, gentle <referent char="Death">Death</referent>, spare me till to-morrow,</line>
<line>That I may amend me</line>
<line>With good advisement.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Death">Death</speaker> Nay, thereto I will not consent,</line>
<line>Nor no man will I respite,</line>
<line>But to the heart suddenly I shall smite</line>
<line>Without any advisement.</line>
<line>And now out of thy sight I will me hie;</line>
<line>See thou make thee ready shortly,</line>
<line>For thou mayst say this is the day</line>
<line>That no man living may scape away.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Alas, I may well weep with sighs deep;</line>
<line>Now have I no manner of company</line>
<line>To help me in my journey, and me to keep;</line>
<line>And also my writing is full unready.</line>
<line>How shall I do now for to excuse me?</line>
<line>I would to God I had never be gete!<note n="10"/></line>
<line>To my soul a full great profit it had be;</line>
<line>For now I fear pains huge and great.</line>
<line>The time passeth; Lord, help that all wrought;</line>
<line>For though I mourn it availeth nought.</line>
<line>The day passeth, and is almost a-go;</line>
<line>I wot not well what for to do.</line>
<line>To whom were I best my complaint to make?</line>
<line>What, and I to <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> thereof spake,</line>
<line>And showed him of this sudden chance?</line>
<line>For in him is all mine affiance;</line>
<line>We have in the world so many a day</line>
<line>Be on good friends in sport and play.</line>
<line>I see him yonder, certainly;</line>
<line>I trust that he will bear me company;</line>
<line>Therefore to him will I speak to ease my sorrow.</line>
<line>Well met, good <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>, and good morrow!</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship speaketh">Fellowship speaketh</speaker> <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, good morrow by this day.</line>
<line>Sir, why lookest thou so piteously?</line>
<line>If any thing be amiss, I pray thee, me say,</line>
<line>That I may help to remedy.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Yea, good <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>, yea,</line>
<line>I am in great jeopardy.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> My true friend, show to me your mind;</line>
<line>I will not forsake thee, unto my life's end,</line>
<line>In the way of good company.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> That was well spoken, and lovingly.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Sir, I must needs know your heaviness;</line>
<line>I have pity to see you in any distress;</line>
<line>If any have you wronged ye shall revenged be,</line>
<line>Though I on the ground be slain for thee,--</line>
<line>Though that I know before that I should die.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Verily, <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>, gramercy.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Tush! by thy thanks I set not a straw.</line>
<line>Show me your grief, and say no more.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> If I my heart should to you break,</line>
<line>And then you to turn your mind from me,</line>
<line>And would not me comfort, when you hear me speak,</line>
<line>Then should I ten times sorrier be.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Sir, I say as I will do in deed.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Then be you a good friend at need:</line>
<line>I have found you true here before.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> And so ye shall evermore;</line>
<line>For, in faith, and thou go to Hell,</line>
<line>I will not forsake thee by the way!</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Ye speak like a good friend; I believe you well;</line>
<line>I shall deserve it, and I may.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> I speak of no deserving, by this day.</line>
<line>For he that will say and nothing do</line>
<line>Is not worthy with good company to go;</line>
<line>Therefore show me the grief of your mind,</line>
<line>As to your friend most loving and kind.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> I shall show you how it is;</line>
<line>Commanded I am to go a journey,</line>
<line>A long way, hard and dangerous,</line>
<line>And give a strait count without delay</line>
<line>Before the high judge Adonai.<note n="11"/></line>
<line>Wherefore I pray you, bear me company,</line>
<line>As ye have promised, in this journey.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> That is matter indeed! Promise is duty,</line>
<line>But, and I should take such a voyage on me,</line>
<line>I know it well, it should be to my pain:</line>
<line>Also it make me afeard, certain.</line>
<line>But let us take counsel here as well as we can,</line>
<line>For your words would fear a strong man.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Why, ye said, If I had need,</line>
<line>Ye would me never forsake, quick nor dead,</line>
<line>Though it were to hell truly.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> So I said, certainly,</line>
<line>But such pleasures be set aside, thee sooth to say:</line>
<line>And also, if we took such a journey,</line>
<line>When should we come again?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Nay, never again till the day of doom.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> In faith, then will not I come there!</line>
<line>Who hath you these tidings brought?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Indeed, <referent char="Death">Death</referent> was with me here.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Now, by God that all hath bought,</line>
<line>If <referent char="Death">Death</referent> were the messenger,</line>
<line>For no man that is living to-day</line>
<line>I will not go that loath journey--</line>
<line>Not for the father that begat me!</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Ye promised other wise, pardie.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> I wot well I say so truly;</line>
<line>And yet if thou wilt eat, and drink, and make good cheer,</line>
<line>Or haunt to women, the lusty company,</line>
<line>I would not forsake you, while the day is clear,</line>
<line>Trust me verily!</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Yea, thereto ye would be ready;</line>
<line>To go to mirth, solace, and play,</line>
<line>Your mind will sooner apply</line>
<line>Than to bear me company in my long journey.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Now, in good faith, I will not that way.</line>
<line>But and thou wilt murder, or any man kill,</line>
<line>In that I will help thee with a good will!</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O that is a simple advice indeed!</line>
<line>Gentle <referent char="fellow">fellow</referent>, help me in my necessity;</line>
<line>We have loved long, and now I need,</line>
<line>And now, gentle <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>, remember me.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Whether ye have loved me or no,</line>
<line>By Saint John, I will not with thee go.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Yet I pray thee, take the labour, and do so much for me</line>
<line>To bring me forward, for saint charity,</line>
<line>And comfort me till I come without the town.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Nay, and thou would give me a new gown,</line>
<line>I will not a foot with thee go;</line>
<line>But and you had tarried I would not have left thee so.</line>
<line>And as now, God speed thee in thy journey,</line>
<line>For from thee I will depart as fast as I may.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Whither away, <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>? will you forsake me?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> Yea, by my fay, to God I betake thee.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Farewell, good <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent>; for this my heart is sore;</line>
<line>Adieu for ever, I shall see thee no more.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Fellowship">Fellowship</speaker> In faith, <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, farewell now at the end;</line>
<line>For you I will remember that parting is mourning.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Alack! shall we thus depart indeed?</line>
<line>Our Lady, help, without any more comfort,</line>
<line>Lo, <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> forsaketh me in my most need:</line>
<line>For help in this world whither shall I resort?</line>
<line><referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> herebefore with me would merry make;</line>
<line>And now little sorrow for me doth he take.</line>
<line>It is said, in prosperity men friends may find,</line>
<line>Which in adversity be full unkind.</line>
<line>Now whither for succour shall I flee,</line>
<line>Sith that <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> hath forsaken me?</line>
<line>To my kinsmen I will truly,</line>
<line>Praying them to help me in my necessity;</line>
<line>I believe that they will do so,</line>
<line>For kind will creep where it may not go.</line>
<line>I will go say, for yonder I see them go.</line>
<line>Where be ye now, my friends and kinsmen?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Kindred">Kindred</speaker> Here be we now at your commandment.</line>
<line><referent char="Cousin">Cousin</referent>, I pray you show us your intent</line>
<line>In any wise, and not spare.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Cousin">Cousin</speaker> Yea, <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, and to us declare</line>
<line>If ye be disposed to go any whither,</line>
<line>For wete you well, we will live and die together.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Kindred">Kindred</speaker> In wealth and woe we will with you hold,</line>
<line>For over his kin a man may be bold.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Gramercy, my friends and kinsmen kind.</line>
<line>Now shall I show you the grief of my mind:</line>
<line>I was commanded by a messenger,</line>
<line>That is an high king's chief officer;</line>
<line>He bade me go a pilgrimage to my pain,</line>
<line>And I know well I shall never come again;</line>
<line>Also I must give a reckoning straight,</line>
<line>For I have a great enemy, that hath me in wait,</line>
<line>Which intendeth me for to hinder.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Kindred">Kindred</speaker> What account is that which ye must render?</line>
<line>That would I know.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Of all my works I must show</line>
<line>How I have lived and my days spent;</line>
<line>Also of ill deeds, that I have used</line>
<line>In my time, sith life was me lent;</line>
<line>And of all virtues that I have refused.</line>
<line>Therefore I pray you go thither with me,</line>
<line>To help to make mine account, for saint <referent char="charity">charity</referent>.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Cousin">Cousin</speaker> What, to go thither? Is that the matter?</line>
<line>Nay, <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, I had liefer fast bread and water</line>
<line>All this five year and more.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Alas, that ever I was bore!<note n="12"/></line>
<line>For now shall I never be merry</line>
<line>If that you forsake me.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Kindred">Kindred</speaker> Ah, sir; what, ye be a merry man!</line>
<line>Take good heart to you, and make no moan.</line>
<line>But one thing I warn you, by Saint Anne,</line>
<line>As for me, ye shall go alone.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> My <referent char="Cousin">Cousin</referent>, will you not with me go?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Cousin">Cousin</speaker> No, by our Lady; I have the cramp in my toe.</line>
<line>Trust not to me, for, so God me speed,</line>
<line>I will deceive you in your most need,</line>
<line><referent char="Kindred.">Kindred.</referent> It availeth not us to tice.</line>
<line>Ye shall have my maid with all my heart;</line>
<line>She loveth to go to feasts, there to be nice,</line>
<line>And to dance, and abroad to start:</line>
<line>I will give her leave to help you in that journey,</line>
<line>If that you and she may agree.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Now show me the very effect of your mind.</line>
<line>Will you go with me, or abide behind?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Kindred">Kindred</speaker> Abide behind? yea, that I will and I may!</line>
<line>Therefore farewell until another day.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> How should I be merry or glad?</line>
<line>For fair promises to me make,</line>
<line>But when I have most need, they me forsake.</line>
<line>I am deceived; that maketh me sad.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Cousin">Cousin</speaker> Cousin <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, farewell now,</line>
<line>For verily I will not go with you;</line>
<line>Also of mine own an unready reckoning</line>
<line>I have to account; therefore I make tarrying.</line>
<line>Now, God keep thee, for now I go.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Ah, <referent char="Jesus">Jesus</referent>, is all come hereto?</line>
<line>Lo, fair words maketh fools feign;</line>
<line>They promise and nothing will do certain.</line>
<line>My kinsmen promised me faithfully</line>
<line>For to abide with me steadfastly,</line>
<line>And now fast away do they flee:</line>
<line>Even so <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> promised me.</line>
<line>What friend were best me of to provide?</line>
<line>I lose my time here longer to abide.</line>
<line>Yet in my mind a thing there is;--</line>
<line>All my life I have loved riches;</line>
<line>If that my good now help me might,</line>
<line>He would make my heart full light.</line>
<line>I will speak to him in this distress.--</line>
<line>Where art thou, my <referent char="Goods">Goods</referent> and riches?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Who calleth me? <referent char="Everyman?">Everyman?</referent> what haste thou hast!</line>
<line>I lie here in corners, trussed and piled so high,</line>
<line>And in chests I am locked so fast,</line>
<line>Also sacked in bags, thou mayst see with thine eye,</line>
<line>I cannot stir; in packs low I lie.</line>
<line>What would ye have, lightly me say.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Come hither, <referent char="Good">Good</referent>, in all the haste thou may,</line>
<line>For of counsel I must desire thee.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Sir, and ye in the world have trouble or adversity,</line>
<line>That can I help you to remedy shortly.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> It is another disease that grieveth me;</line>
<line>In this world it is not, I tell thee so.</line>
<line>I am sent for another way to go,</line>
<line>To give a straight account general</line>
<line>Before the highest <referent char="Jupiter">Jupiter</referent> of all;</line>
<line>And all my life I have had joy and pleasure in thee.</line>
<line>Therefore I pray thee go with me,</line>
<line>For, peradventure, thou mayst before God Almighty</line>
<line>My reckoning help to clean and purify;</line>
<line>For it is said ever among,</line>
<line>That money maketh all right that is wrong.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Nay, <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, I sing another song,</line>
<line>I follow no man in such voyages;</line>
<line>For and I went with thee</line>
<line>Thou shouldst fare much the worse for me;</line>
<line>For because on me thou did set thy mind,</line>
<line>Thy reckoning I have made blotted and blind,</line>
<line>That thine account thou cannot make truly;</line>
<line>And that hast thou for the love of me.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> That would grieve me full sore,</line>
<line>When I should come to that fearful answer.</line>
<line>Up, let us go thither together.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Nay, not so, I am too brittle, I may not endure;</line>
<line>I will follow no man one foot, be ye sure.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Alas, I have thee loved, and had great pleasure</line>
<line>All my life-days on good and treasure.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> That is to thy damnation without lesing,</line>
<line>For my love is contrary to the love everlasting.</line>
<line>But if thou had me loved moderately during,</line>
<line>As, to the poor give part of me,</line>
<line>Then shouldst thou not in this dolour be,</line>
<line>Nor in this great sorrow and care.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Lo, now was I deceived or I was ware,</line>
<line>And all I may wyte<note n="13"/> my spending of time.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> What, weenest thou that I am thine?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> I had wend so.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Nay, <referent char="Everyman,">Everyman,</referent> I say no;</line>
<line>As for a while I was lent thee,</line>
<line>A season thou hast had me in prosperity;</line>
<line>My condition is man's soul to kill;</line>
<line>If I save one, a thousand I do spill;</line>
<line>Weenest thou that I will follow thee?</line>
<line>Nay, from this world, not verily.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> I had wend otherwise.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Therefore to thy soul <referent char="Good">Good</referent> is a thief;</line>
<line>For when thou art dead, this is my guise</line>
<line>Another to deceive in the same wise</line>
<line>As I have done thee, and all to his soul's reprief.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O false <referent char="Good">Good</referent>, cursed thou be!</line>
<line>Thou traitor to God, that hast deceived me,</line>
<line>And caught me in thy snare.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> Marry, thou brought thyself in care,</line>
<line>Whereof I am glad,</line>
<line>I must needs laugh, I cannot be sad.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> Ah, <referent char="Good">Good</referent>, thou hast had long my heartly love;</line>
<line>I gave thee that which should be the Lord's above.</line>
<line>But wilt thou not go with me in deed?</line>
<line>I pray thee truth to say.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Goods">Goods</speaker> No, so God me speed,</line>
<line>Therefore farewell, and have good day.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Everyman">Everyman</speaker> O, to whom shall I make my moan</line>
<line>For to go with me in that heavy journey?</line>
<line>First <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> said he would with me gone;</line>
<line>His words were very pleasant and gay,</line>
<line>But afterward he left me alone.</line>
<line>Then spake I to my kinsmen all in despair,</line>
<line>And also they gave me words fair,</line>
<line>They lacked no fair speaking,</line>
<line>But all forsake me in the ending.</line>
<line>Then went I to my <referent char="Goods">Goods</referent> that I loved best,</line>
<line>In hope to have comfort, but there had I least;</line>
<line>For my <referent char="Goods">Goods</referent> sharply did me tell</line>
<line>That he bringeth many into hell.</line>
<line>Then of myself I was ashamed,</line>
<line>And so I am worthy to be blamed;</line>
<line>Thus may I well myself hate.</line>
<line>Of whom shall I now counsel take?</line>
<line>I think that I shall never speed</line>
<line>Till that I go to my <referent char="Good-Deed">Good-Deed</referent>,</line>
<line>But alas, she is so weak,</line>
<line>That she can neither go nor speak;</line>
<line>Yet will I venture on her now.--</line>
<line>My <referent char="Good-Deeds">Good-Deeds</referent>, where be you?</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Good-Deeds">Good-Deeds</speaker> Here I lie cold in the ground;</line>

<line>I must you pray of counsel,</line>
<line>For help now should come right well.</line>

<line>God's body in flesh and blood to make,</line>
<line>And handleth his maker between his hands;</line>
<line>The priest bindeth and unbindeth all bands,</line>
<line>Both in earth and in heaven;</line>
<line>Thou ministers all the sacraments seven;</line>
<line>Though we kissed thy feet thou were worthy;</line>
<line>Thou art surgeon that cureth sin deadly:</line>
<line>No remedy we find under God</line>
<line>But all only priesthood.</line>
<line><referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>, God gave priests that dignity,</line>
<line>And setteth them in his stead among us to be;</line>
<line>Thus be they above angels in degree.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Knowledge">Knowledge</speaker> If priests be good it is so surely;</line>
<line>But when Jesus hanged on the cross with great smart</line>
<line>There he gave, out of his blessed heart,</line>
<line>The same sacrament in great torment:</line>
<line>He sold them not to us, that Lord Omnipotent.</line>
<line>Therefore Saint Peter the apostle doth say</line>
<line>That Jesu's curse hath all they</line>
<line>Which God their Saviour do buy or sell,</line>
<line>Or they for any money do take or tell.</line>
<line>Sinful priests giveth the sinners example bad;</line>
<line>Their children sitteth by other men's fires, I have heard;</line>
<line>And some haunteth women's company,</line>
<line>With unclean life, as lusts of lechery</line>
<line>These be with sin made blind.</line>

</speech>
<speech><line><speaker char="Five-wits">Five-wits</speaker> I trust to God no such may we find;</line>
<line>Therefore let us priesthood honour,</line>
<line>And follow their doctrine for our souls' succour;</line>

<line>By whom we all be kept in surety.</line>
<line>Peace, for yonder I see <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> come,</line>
